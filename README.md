LLM-Memorizer:-

This is my first every MCP server which helps the Large Language Models (LLM) to save the data by using MCP server in supabase
and read and bring it to the user on the basis of Date and Time provided by the user .

MCP Tools:

There are two Tools in this MCP server:-

1> save_memory : This tool helps the LLM to save the data which the user want to save for the long term in the Supabase with the help of MCP server .

2> search_memory : This tool helps the LLM to Bring the saved data on the Supabase and when the user want to re-call the data the LLm on the basis of time and date it will re-call it.
